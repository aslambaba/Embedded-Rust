## LED Code with Manual Configurations of Peripheral and Registers using API

Now before this we complete how to operate our LED's using High Level api and also with Raw pointers in unsafe rust. Now we code how to operate our LED's with manualy configure our Peripherals and Registers using API. 

#### User Registers and Peripherals 

- Peripherals => GPIOE, RCC.
- Registers => ORD in GPIOE and AHBENR in RCC.
